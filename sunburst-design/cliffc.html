                Cliff Cummings is Vice President of Training at Paradigm Works and Founder of Sunburst Design.
                Cliff has 42 years of ASIC, FPGA and system design experience and 32 years of combined Verilog,
                SystemVerilog, UVM verification, synthesis, and methodology training experience.
                Cliff has completed many ASIC designs, FPGA designs and system simulation projects,
                and can answer the very technical questions asked by experienced design engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cliff has taught expert Verilog, SystemVerilog, Design, Synthesis, CDC and UVM Verification
                to thousands of engineers world-wide since 1992 and has presented more than 50 papers on topics
                related to Verilog, SystemVerliog, synthesis and UVM verification. More than 25 of Cliff's
                works have been voted "Best Paper" at various conferences.

                the featured speaker for the 2018 Accellera Day India on the IEEE 1800.2 UVM Standard,
                and the 2019 DVCon U.S. Accellera tutorial presenter, also on the IEEE 1800.2 UVM Standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cliff has been a member of the IEEE 1364 Verilog and IEEE 1800 SystemVerilog Standards Groups
                from 1994 to present-day and was the only Verilog and SystemVerilog trainer to help develop
                these important IEEE and Accellera Verilog & SystemVerilog Standards.
            </p>
